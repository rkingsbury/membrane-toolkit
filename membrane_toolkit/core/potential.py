    """
    Calculate the apparent permselectivity of a membrane from the membrane potential.

    Args:
        E_mem (float): Electrical potential across the membrane [V]
        E_ideal (float): Electrical potential across an ideally-selective membrane,
            usually calculated via the Nernst equation [V]
        t_counter (float): bulk solution transport number of the counter ion.
            [dimensionless]. Must be between 0 and 1.

    Returns:
        float: Apparent permselectivity of the membrane, [dimensionless]

    Notes:
        Apparent permselectivity ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents a non-selective
        membrane and 1 represents a perfectly-selective membrane. Apparent
        permselectivity is calculated from the membrane potential and differs from the
        "true" permselectivity. The equation is:

        .. math::

            \\alpha_{app} = \\frac{\\frac{E_{mem}}{E_{ideal}} + 1 - 2 t_{counter}}
                {2 t_{co}}
