There are currently two primary ways to use it: A Calculator \u00b6 membrane-toolkit's core module packages complex equations from the literature into rigorous, validated Python routines that make it fast and easy to perform state-of-the-science analysis. Each core function has detailed documentation, including formulas, assumptions, and references, and is thoroughly tested for correctness using published data. Compared to manual calculations, using core functions to perform calculations saves time, improves quality, increases reproducibility, and reduces the chances of error. In addition, every core function is available with support for automatic unit conversion, eliminating another potential source of error. Core functions can be used for standalone calculations, as part of a data analysis pipline, or as building blocks for sophisticated transport models. An automatic Data Aggregator \u00b6 membrane-toolkit's pipeline module makes it easy to automatically aggregate and process experimental data. It leverages the maggma framework to collect parse data from Excel spreadsheets into versatible objects called Stores that can interface with numerous database providers, including MongoDB, Pandas dataframes, Amazon storage, and more. A typical data aggregation pipeline consists of the following steps: Choose or customize a Drone, which defines the file format to use when collecting experimental data. Collect data using the template, one file per experiment. Run the Drone to aggregate all the data into a Store View, summarize, and analyze the data in the Store Update as you generate more data. membrane-toolkit's Drones are smart enough to know when files have been updated and to re-parse accordingly. membrane-toolkit is written in Python and supports Python 3.+.

Please note that membrane-toolkit is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct . By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. Coding Concepts \u00b6 membrane-toolkit is designed to work closely with the family of codes maintained by The Materials Project . In particular, we follow the major architectural decisions of the pymatgen maintainers regarding coding style, test framework, Python compatbility, etc. Key third-party libraries \u00b6 Wherever possible, we import functionality from other codes rather than duplicate functionality. For example, we use pint's Quantity class to handle unit conversion. It will be especially helpful to familiarize yourself with the following methods and packages, in addition to standard scientific Python codes like numpy and scipy: MSONable , loadfn and dumpfn serialization routines from the monty package Drone , Builder , and Store classes from maggma Units-aware computation using pint Quantity objects. Code Organization \u00b6 The code is organized according to the following scheme. The core module contains fully documented, thoroughly tested, standalone functions for key calculations, implemented with floating point math and available in unitized versions with Quantity support in the unitized module. The core module is where the science lives, and standards for code quality and test coverage are enforced most rigorously here. The pipeline module contains all the infrastructure for data aggregation, including Drone, Store, and Builder definitions and templates. test files are placed in /test subdirectories of the module that they test. One test file per module, named \"test_ .py\" Coding Guidelines \u00b6 To ensure the long-term sustainability of the membrane-toolkit codebase, we enforce very strict quality control standards for all contributions. Specifically, all new code must adhere to the following: Tests are required for all new modules and methods. The only way to minimize regression and ensure confidence in membrane-toolkit's calculations is to thoroughly test all code. If the maintainer cannot test your code, the contribution will be rejected. Test should conform to the following schema: * Use [ pytest ]( https : // docs . pytest . org / en / latest / ) * Place tests in files named `test_xxxx.py` in a `tests` subdirectory of the directory where your code resides . * If your test requires external files , place those in `test_files` in the root membrane - toolkit directory . * Test all realistic combinations of input arguments Documentation required for all modules, classes and methods. In particular: * The method docstrings should explain ALL required and optional arguments and return values * Methods and docstrings should use [ TypeHinting ] ( https : // docs . python . org / 3 / library / typing . html ) * Use [ Google-style ] ( https : // google . github . io / styleguide / pyguide . html ) docstrings * Include a ` References :` section with citations where appropriate PyCodeStyle , flake8 , and mypy are used to lint (check) all code, and all code is expected to adhere to this style.
